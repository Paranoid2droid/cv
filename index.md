## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="homer.jpg">

Hi! I am a graduate student of Institute of Acoustics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, majoring in audio signal processing.

Besides the projects concerning on DSP implementation I am doing in work hours, I also has a mania for computer music and creative coding. I'm now scratching up [my Github page](https://github.com/Paranoid2droid){:target="_blank"} to share my ChucK codes, MAX/MSP projects ,and other whatever things I built.

I'm also a bedroom music maker and amateur guitar/bass/drum/synthesizer player! I've released a few EPs and albums with my bandmates or in my own name. Check [my Soundcloud page](https://soundcloud.com/paranoid2droid){:target="_blank"} to hear my works!

One more thing, I am selected as an AMBASSADOR on [Kadenze](https://www.kadenze.com/){:target="_blank"}, which is an amazing place for learn and make all kinds of cool stuff. Meet me [there](https://www.kadenze.com/users/zhe-zhang){:target="_blank"}!

## Research Interest

I got a Bachelor Degree in Physics, focusing on Acoustics. I engaged in some projects on room acoustics and concert hall design when I was an undergraduate. I also got a part-time job as an associate audio engineer and stage tech in the most professional livehouse in Shanghai. 

Right now I am doing my Master Degree in Electronic Engineering, with a research subject on DSP implementation of audio processing algorithms. I'm developing real-time system of sound field analysis, including far-field sound source localization and near-field acoustical holography. 

With my experiences of acoustics and audio, I found my passion for research landed on the cross point of computer, music, and acoustics. I finished more than 10 courses on Kadenze about music technology and computer music, including ChucK, MAX/MSP, Physics-DSP, Machine Learning, FAUST, Machine Learning, Web, etc... And I am still working with them to build more interesting and meaningful things. I am looking forward to meet an opportunity to dig into music technology and computer music.
