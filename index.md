## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="photo.jpg">

Hi! I am a graduate student from [Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.ioa.cas.cn/){:target="_blank"}, majoring in audio signal processing.

On top of the research projects about DSP algorithms in work hours, I also have a mania for computer music and music tech. I'm now starting [my Github page](https://github.com/Paranoid2droid){:target="_blank"} from scratch to share my ChucK codes, MAX/MSP projects, plug-ins and other things I built.

I'm also a music maker and multi-instrument player. I've released a few EPs and albums. You may check them out on [my SoundCloud page](https://soundcloud.com/paranoid2droid){:target="_blank"}.

One more thing, I am selected as an AMBASSADOR on [Kadenze](https://www.kadenze.com/){:target="_blank"}, which is an amazing place for learn and make all kinds of cool stuff. Meet me [there](https://www.kadenze.com/users/zhe-zhang){:target="_blank"}!

## Research Interest

I earned a B.S. Degree in Applied Physics, focusing on Acoustics. I engaged in a research on room acoustics and concert hall design during undergraduate years. I also worked as an associate audio engineer and stage tech in [MAO Livehouse](http://mao-music.com){:target="_blank"}.

Right now I am doing my M.E. Degree in Electronic Engineering, with a research subject on DSP implementation of audio processing algorithms. I'm developing real-time systems of sound field analysis, including far-field sound source localization and near-field acoustical holography. 

With my experiences of acoustics and audio, I found my passion for research land on the cross point of computer, music, and acoustics. Lately I've finished [more than 10 courses on Kadenze](https://www.kadenze.com/users/zhe-zhang#tab-certificates){:target="_blank"} related to music technology, computer music and creative coding, including ChucK, MAX/MSP, Physics-DSP, JUCE, FAUST, Machine Learning, Web, etc. And I am still working with them to build more interesting and meaningful works. I am looking forward to finding an opportunity to dig into music technology and computer music.

## Research Projects

<img class="project-picture" src="research_6.gif">

* 2019: Real-time DSP Sound Source Localization System Based on Circular Microphone Array Using SRP Method in Harmonic Domain

Optimized SRP algorithm in circular harmonic domain for DSP and developed a real-time sound source localization system which can estimate the azimuth of sound source with one-frame latency.  

<img class="project-picture" src="research_5.jpg">

* 2019: Sound Localization and Separation in Three-dimensional Space Using a Single Microphone with a Metamaterial Enclosure

Used a 3D-printed enclosure to modify the frequency response of an omnidirectional microphone in a direction-independent way, utilized compress sensing techniques and other processing to reconstruct the information about location and audio content of sound sources.

<img class="project-picture" src="research_4.gif">

* 2018: DSP-Based Implementation of a Real-time Sound Field Visualization System Using SONAH Algorithm

Studied techniques of near-field acoustical holography algorithms such as SONAH, develop real-time DSP systems to visualize sound field with details of evanescent waves.

<img class="project-picture" src="research_3.jpg">

* 2018: Improved MUSIC Algorithm with Enhanced Matrix for Estimating Harmonic Components

Estimated the number of harmonic components by observing the trend of eigenvalue of self-correlation matrix of the signal's enhanced matrix to determine the sub-space of MUSIC algorithm, providing a better performance in low SNR situations.

<img class="project-picture" src="research_2.jpg">

* 2017: Measurement of Total Sound Energy Density Based on Sound Field Microphone

Designed filter banks converting A-Format audio signal captured by sound field microphones into B-Format and to obtain three-dimensional particle vibration velocity and total sound energy density.

<img class="project-picture" src="research_1.jpg">

* 2016: Study on the Decay of Sound Energy in Stage-Auditorium Coupled Sound Field of Theaters

Based on a scale model of a theater in sound-proof chamber, modified the acoustic absorption coefficient of stage and auditorium to predict the reverberation in different location inside a theater with acoustical coupling phenomenon between stage and auditorium.
