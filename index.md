## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="photo.jpg">

Hi! I'm an audio algorithm engineer and researcher in a music technology start-up now. I got a Master's degree in electronic engineering, focusing on audio signal processing and a Bachelor's degree in applied physics, focusing on acoustics. 

On top of my research experience in audio and DSP, I also have a mania for computer music and music tech. All the source codes of my synthesizers, plug-ins, audiovisual, computer music and other stuff are on [my Github page](https://github.com/Paranoid2droid){:target="_blank"}.

I'm also a music maker and multi-instrument player. Check out my released albums and EPs on [my SoundCloud page](https://soundcloud.com/paranoid2droid){:target="_blank"}.

One more thing, I am selected as an AMBASSADOR on [Kadenze](https://www.kadenze.com/){:target="_blank"}, which is an amazing place for learn and make all kinds of cool stuff. Meet me [there](https://www.kadenze.com/users/zhe-zhang){:target="_blank"}!

## Research Interest

During undergraduate period, I engaged in a research on room acoustics and concert hall design. I also worked as an associate sound engineer and stage tech in [MAO Livehouse](http://mao-music.com){:target="_blank"} during undergraduate years.

In graduate institute, my research subject was DSP implementation of audio processing algorithms. I researched on front-end audio algorithms and developed real-time sound field analysis systems, including far-field sound source localization and near-field acoustical holography. 

With my experiences of acoustics and audio, I found my passion for research land on the cross point of computer, music, and acoustics. I finished [more than 10 courses on Kadenze](https://www.kadenze.com/users/zhe-zhang#tab-certificates){:target="_blank"} related to music technology, computer music and creative coding, including ChucK, MAX/MSP, Physics-DSP, JUCE, FAUST, Machine Learning, Web, etc., and built several personal projects including synthesizers, audio plug-ins, and interactive computer music.

After graduation, I joined a music technology start-up as an audio algorithm engineer. I develop audio algorithms in our AI-driven virtual singer app, including DL-based singing voice synthesizing and traditional music signal processing like time stretching and pitch shifting. I am looking forward to digging into music technology and computer music.
